            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
              At Dezignz, we are constantly on the lookout for new challenges and innovative products that require visionary and creative design. So when we were approached by FreeYourData and their idea for a new personal data marketplace, we had no choice but to accept their offer to design the application from start to finish. FreeYourData is a company that wishes to liberate users of modern technology, by offering them a means of controlling their own personal data, rather than trusting the management of such data with tech giants such as Google, Facebook, Uber, and the like. Data such as fitness tracking information, smartphone data, GPS location, and IoT use are among many categories of personal data that FreeYourData will allow you to have complete ownership over, and give you the power to sell your data to whom you chose. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className={styles.section}>
            <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            FreeYourData will be essentially a cross-platform mobile app, and the idea is for it to be a marketplace where you can track, monitor, sell, and negotiate what is done with your personal information. Our team felt the best approach would be to take inspiration for the user interface from well-established and beautifully designed e-commerce applications already on the market today. The biggest challenge with this project is finding an elegant way to organize and display personal data spanning across possibly hundreds of different platforms. For example, a typical internet user would have accounts with multiple platforms such as Instagram, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Uber, Linkedin, Spotify, among others. To take on such an obstacle, we conducted some research which revealed that a subscription-based approach, where the user can sync a given account from a certain platform on demand, would be most ideal.

            <h2>Research Methods</h2>
            <h3>User Needs & Desires</h3>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The first and most important task we wanted to tackle was to establish the interest or need for such a service. We wanted to make sure that the everyday online user is in fact concerned about the various ways their data is being collected and used. Our aim was to test if there is enough interest for users to control their own data and earn money while doing so. We began by conducting a brief <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9Nbz4jcQSJiUeG2APWy9HHxVXPULGIqscSKOAURvigVTpSw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">survey</a> from which we were able to obtain data showing that the majority of people do not feel comfortable about how their personal data may be used by online platforms. In addition, about 92% of respondents stated a desire to have more control over their personal data.

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            This survey also revealed that 92% of respondents would like to have more control and receive compensation for their role in the success of the tech industry and their marketing strategies. Answers collected through the survey conveyed that most people are specifically interested in having access to a subscription based mobile application that would allow them to see and control exactly what data is being used and collected with respect to their individual online presence and interests.

            <h3>Design Inspirations</h3>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            The second task was for us to determine the simplest possible way for such an app to operate and exist. We began our research by studying and taking inspiration from the design of various e-commerce applications widely available to the public. Such apps included the likes of Shopify, SquareSpace, 3dcart etc. which gave us an idea for the general layout for our application. Furthermore, this research gave us some insight into the main features that users enjoy when operating an ecommerce application. Such features include having a wallet directly in the app or the ability to use third party payment services such as PayPal or Apple Pay. In-app wallets are attractive to users, and in some cases can also influence their decisions concerning purchases. 
            </p>

            </div>

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Another place from which we drew inspiration was the user experience typical of most trading applications. These applications tend to give a detailed breakdown of the history of a particular stock, and they show statistics and graphs that provide the user with visuals that are important for the user to feel as if they are up to date and educated on how their assets are doing. We thought that such graphs and statistics could help our users understand exactly what, when, where and by whom their data is being used and give them the opportunity to control what they share.  
            </p>

            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            The main font used in FreeYourData will be Apple SD Gothic Neo. This font was chosen for its simplicity, elegance and adaptability to various textual positions such as titles, subtitles, notes and descriptions. Besides the font itself, the team at Designz took care of adjusting the text properties in order to bring and spacious and fluid navigation.
            </p>

            <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            Finally, concerning our choice of the color palette for our app, it was crucial that we perform research on colors associated with trust and positive energy. Such a decision to go with color that exude these qualities was imperative since the main goal of our app is to provide our users with a feeling of safety and control. Thus, our choice of using a blue colour palette was carefully and specifically made with the aim to design a safe space where our users can ensure that their data is only being used with their discretion and according to their tailored specifications. Blue also gives the user a sense of calmness. We initially compiled a list of 4 colour palettes all containing the same hue of blue, but with different colour accents. We included another question in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9Nbz4jcQSJiUeG2APWy9HHxVXPULGIqscSKOAURvigVTpSw/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">survey</a> which asked the respondent for their preference. Out of all the options, this was the one which was most popular with about 56% of respondents indicating their preference for it:

          <div id="FYDS" className={styles.section}>
            <h2>FYDS</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            In order to transfer the data collected from the users, FreeYourData introduces an application currency which is called a FYD (FreeYourData). The users will receive FYDs in exchange for their data. Once a user has enough of this currency, he can exchange the FYDs for dollars depending on the present market value of this digital currency. One FYD will be given for a particular amount of data collected. The reason behind choosing to instore a digital currency for the app is to provide an independent asset for the compagnies so that they can define how much they are willing to exchange FYDs for the gathered data. Another intent to introduce FYDs is to provide some distance between monetary and data assets. One of the most important points behind the vision of FreeYourData is to make user data an asset which maintains its own intrinsic value.

          </div>

          {/* User Persona ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */}
          <div id="personas" className={styles.section}>
            <h2>User Personas</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            When designing FreeYourData, it was crucial to not overlook the importance of brainstorming potential users of the application. For the purposes of our prototype design, we thought it would be most appropriate to present two unique user personas, which we feel represent the different needs that the app will need to address.
            </p>

            <h3>Samantha Fraser</h3>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
             To start, we created the persona of Samantha Fraser, who we feel will represent a very large portion of FreeYourData's users – young, tech savvy individuals within the 18-35 age range looking for more transparency and new means of earning income. Samantha, like many other young users, enjoys simplistic and intuitive user experiences, more control over her personal data, and wants access to innovative ways of managing her various online accounts. 
            </p>

            <img className={styles.persona} src="samantha.png"/>
            <div className={styles.figureDescriptor}>
              (Figure 12) User Persona: Samantha Fraser
            </div>

            <h3>Joe Hampton</h3>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Next, we introduce the persona of Joe Hampton. We feel Joe represents the opposite spectrum of user when compared with Samantha. Joe is a baby-boomer, who is less adept to new technologies, and more resistant to change. However, Joe is very concerned with privacy and having full transparency and control over his online data. Unlike Samantha, Joe has less trust in many popular online platforms, and we hope that the design of FreeYourData will entice users like Joe to become more engaged and active users by offering a sense of security and online transparency. Joe further reinforces the need to have a simplistic and intuitive user interface, so that users of all sorts of backgrounds can easily adapt to using FreeYourData.

          {/* User flow chart ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/}
          <div id="userflow" className={styles.section}>
          <h2>User Flow Chart</h2>

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            We wanted FreeYourData to make the user experience as seamless and intuitive as possible. To start, we created a user flow chart to map the various actions a user of the app may take. When the user first opens the app, they will be greeted by a Welcome screen. If the user has already used the application before on their device, a login form will appear on the welcome screen. If the app is newly added to the device, the user will be shown a registration form.
            </p>
 
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Once the user has logged in, they will be taken to the Dashboard view, where they can select one of the following options: Subscriptions, Profile, or Wallet. The Subscription option when selected will bring the user to a new view, where they can view accounts of companies that they have already synched with the app. For example, if a user has synched their Google account with FreeYourData, they will be able to view their subscription. Each subscription is associated with a module, which controls and stores all the metadata of the subscription as well as the user’s associated personal data to the subscription, which the user will be able to view inside the Profile of their account in FreeYourData. The user will also be able to browse from a list of available platforms, where they will have the option to add new subscriptions to their FreeYourData account. 
            </p>

            <img className={styles.image} src="user-flowchart.png"/>

            </div>

            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            In the Profile view, the user will be able to access and view all personal data statistics associated with each account that exists in the Subscriptions view. They will also be able to control what data each subscription has permission to use, and may negotiate the asking price for their personal data tied to that particular subscription. They will be able to also edit and view their personal information associated with their FreeYourData account, such as their name, contact information, login, and password.
            </p>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            Lastly, in the Wallet view, the user will be able to view how much compensation they currently have accumulated from each subscription on their account. They will have the option to redeem earnings from their personal data either through PayPal, Apple Pay, or Google Wallet.  The user will be able to navigate back to the dashboard view at any point while using the app.  
            </p>
          </div>

          {/* sketches ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ */}
          <div id="sketches" className={styles.section}>
            <h2>Sketches</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            The sketches produced for FreeYourData were an initial point of research to determine the general flow of the application. It is from these sketches that the team from Designz has established the main views of the application: Dashboard, Wallet and Browse. The Dashboard represents the main view of the app where the user will be able to consult his subscriptions. The Browse view allows the user to explore new subscriptions that might be relevant to his activities. Finally, the Wallet view is where the user will be able to consult his FYD earnings and retrieve the monetary values. In the initial part  of the research, the sketches have raised important questions about the application design such as how would the compagnies define the data points to be gathered from the users and how these data points can be transferred to monetary values. Eventually, these questions were solved by the introduction of modules and FYD currency. In short, the modules that are part of a specific subscription would gather the data about a specific interaction of a user. As an example, the Google suite subscription has many modules. One such module is the voice module which will record all the data points related to voice activity. The modules will exchange user data for an average amount of FYDs.

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            From the sketches, we have built the wireframes in order to provide a better understanding where each app functionality should be placed. The navigation of the application is clearly defined in this wireframe. The bottom of the views serve as the main navigation tool for users to seamlessly access the dashboard, their wallet and to browse for new subscriptions. Additionally, the sizes of subscriptions and modules were determined in the wireframes in order to provide a visual aesthetic which is spacious and modern. The purpose of the wireframe was to further explore the functionality of the app and to define the position of various app objects. This was an important step to translate the sketch into a fully fleshed mock-up.

He is particularly interested in monitoring the data points gathered from Voice Controls. In the third view, the user continues to use Google voice recognition technology but the data is now passed to FreeYourData services. The user can now be compensated for providing his data to the company. In the last view, the user can exchange the accumulated  FYDs for a monetary value.

            Screen number two shows the core of our app, the dashboard. Here, the user can see all services to which they have subscribed in the past along with a small graph that provides a visual representation of their earnings up until the current date. The page also shows the exact number of FYDs they’ve accumulated since they’ve subscribed and is scrollable so that the user can see all of their subscribed apps.

            Screen number six is reachable when a user has selected an app they are not subscribed to from the previous browse screen. Here, the user will see a general description of the selected “module” or app along with different subscription options they have. For example screen 6 shows the module for Google. It informs the user that they can choose what data they would like to share from a predefined set of data types. In the case of the Google module, these data types include Voice, Location, Face Recognition and Heart Rate. The user can see how many people are currently subscribed to a particular data type and can click on each available data type for more information. Alternatively, the user can select the Subscribe button at the top to quickly start sharing all data types associated with the module. 
            </p>

            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            Screen number seven shows the information page for a particular data type. It informs the user exactly what type of data the user would be giving up should they subscribe along with the amount of FYDs they would gain per unit of sharing. Should the user want to subscribe they can do so by simply clicking on the toggle button provided. The screen indicates that no data has been collected for this data type in the past. Finally, the screen refers the user to an agreements clause where they can read such information in further detail. 
            </p>

            <p className={styles.paragraph}> 
            Screen number eight is similar to that in number six, however it depicts the case when a user selects, from the browse page or from their dashboard, an app they have already subscribed to in the past. This Screen would give the user the same information provided in screen number seven with the addition of specifying which data types are already Active. It gives the user the option to quickly unsubscribe from all active modules by clicking the unsubscribe button at the top right of the screen. 
            </p>

            Screen number nine is accessible when the user selects an already active data type from the previous screen. Here the user has the option to turn off this particular data type as well as to see the individual gains from sharing said data type. The user has 3 options for the breakdown of their gains; they can choose a monthly view, a yearly view or an all time view. 
            </p>
